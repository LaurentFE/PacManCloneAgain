## State of the project
Target results achieved :
- Have a fully navigable maze
- Pac-Man can be moved around the maze, respecting constraints
4 Ghosts are displayed on the maze (but cannot be interacted with, and do not have any behaviour)

## Context of the project
### WHAT
A clone of the classic arcade game Pac-Man, in Java.\
This project is created after a code review with an experienced Java developer, also experienced in game development.\
It aims to have the same final product as the previous PacManClone project, but with better practices, and code organisation.

### HOW
Developed in Java JDK 21

IDE : https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ (Community Edition)\
Java Code Style : https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html (Automated in IDE)

### WHY
The goals are :
- To create a video game purely in Java
- To implement the better practices outlined by the code review with an experienced Java Developer.

### SCOPE
The target result is :
- Have a fully navigable maze
- Pac-Man can be moved around the maze, respecting constraints
- 4 Ghosts chase Pac-Man with different behaviours to reach him
- Ghosts can chase, disperse, be frightened, and go resurrect at their base
- Pac-Man can eat pellets to increase score
- Pac-Man can eat a power pellet to make them frightened
- Pac-Man can eat a frightened ghost, increasing score and forcing the ghost to go resurrect at their base
